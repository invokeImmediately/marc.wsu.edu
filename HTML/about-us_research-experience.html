			<h2>Academic Year</h2>
			<p>Trainees will complete three two-week mini-rotations in different laboratories. These rotations are not intended to have enough time to complete a project; rather it is a chance for trainees to meet and work with the lab members and be introduced to their research and techniques.</p>
			<p>Trainees will then select a research laboratory.  MARC-WSU scholars are required to work 15 &#8211; 20 hours per week on their research project once they are paired with a research mentor. The hours on a project do not always involve lab bench work. This time does include reading the literature, preparing to present at a conference, analyzing data, etc.</p>
			<p>MARC-WSU scholars will develop a compact with their research mentor that sets out expectations for the MARC-WSU research experience.</p>
